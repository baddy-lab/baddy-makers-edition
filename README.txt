Specific non commercial use term: This source Hardware plan may be copied, distributed, modified by any individual
and non profit organizations (Fablab, Hackerspaces, Makerspaces, universities, Schools), as long
as it follows the CERN OHL V1.1 license terms here attached.
Corporate institutions and private companies may only copy and distribute the Hardware plan without modification.
Therefore, they are not allowed to modify the Hardware plan prior to distributing it for commercial purpose.
So for example, if a user embeds or modifies or relies on the Hardware plan in a product that is
then sold to a third party, this would be a violation of the Non-Commercial Use License additional term. 
By adding this additional restriction, it is intended to encourage the evolution of BADDY Hardware plan
